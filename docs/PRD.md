Of course. Here is a revised Product Requirements Document (PRD) that is sharply focused on an MVP and specifically tailored for the unique dynamics of the Indian medical recruitment market.

The key changes focus on mobile-first design, WhatsApp integration, and a simplified feature set to validate the core problem in the Indian context as quickly as possible.

1. Overview & Introduction

MedConnect is a mobile-first recruitment platform designed to be the most efficient way for Indian medical professionals to find jobs and for healthcare institutions to hire them. This platform addresses the unique challenges of the Indian market, such as the high volume of applicants, geographic diversity (Tier-1/2/3 cities), and the importance of specific local credentials.

This PRD outlines the scope for an MVP aimed at validating one core loop: getting quality job listings from hospitals in front of relevant, verified professionals in a way that is faster and more trustworthy than existing methods (like generic job sites or consultant networks).

2. The Problem (Indian Context)

For Medical Professionals (Candidates):

Information Overload: Job portals are filled with spam, outdated listings from consultants, and roles with vague descriptions. It's impossible to tell which openings are genuine.

Geographic Mismatch: A doctor in Kerala has no easy way to find relevant openings in Delhi without navigating dozens of individual hospital career pages.

Credential Hell: Every application requires re-entering complex degree information (MBBS, MD, MS, DNB) and State Medical Council registration details.

For Healthcare Employers (Recruiters):

Resume Flood: Posting on generic sites leads to hundreds of applications from unqualified or non-serious candidates, creating a massive screening bottleneck.

Verification Burden: Verifying the credentials and registrations of applicants from different states is a time-consuming, manual process.

Limited Reach: It is difficult for a hospital in a Tier-2 city to reach qualified specialists in a Tier-1 metro who might be looking to relocate.

3. Goals & Objectives
Business Goals

Prove that a dedicated, mobile-first platform can attract an initial critical mass of both doctors/nurses and hospitals in India.

Achieve initial traction in one or two key metro areas (e.g., Delhi NCR, Bangalore) to create network density.

Validate a future "freemium" business model where job posting is free, but employer visibility features are paid.

Product Goals for MVP

Candidate Onboarding: Successfully sign up 200 medical professionals, primarily through mobile web.

Employer Onboarding: Successfully sign up 25 employers (hospitals and large clinics).

Core Loop Validation: Facilitate 100 applications where a candidate's profile and CV are successfully delivered to an employer's designated email.

4. Target Audience & User Personas (Indian Context)

Persona 1: The Candidate

Name: Dr. Priya Sharma

Role: Junior Doctor (MBBS, 2 years experience) working at a small nursing home in Delhi.

Goals: Find a residency (DNB) or a better-paying position at a reputable corporate hospital (like Max or Fortis). Wants to use her phone to search for jobs during her breaks.

Frustrations: Her WhatsApp is full of spam from recruitment consultants. Job sites are confusing and not optimized for her phone.

Persona 2: The Employer

Name: Mr. Anand Joshi

Role: HR Manager at a 150-bed multi-specialty hospital in Pune.

Goals: Hire 5 Registered Nurses with ICU experience and 2 general duty MBBS doctors.

Frustrations: Spends his entire week sorting through irrelevant CVs from Naukri.com. The genuine candidates he finds through consultants demand very high salaries because of the agency fees involved.

5. Scope and Features (MVP User Stories)
Epic 1: Mobile-First Core & Onboarding

Story 1.1: As a user on my mobile phone, I want to land on a simple, fast-loading homepage that tells me MedConnect is "The Easiest Way for Doctors & Nurses to Find Jobs in India."

Story 1.2: As a user, I want to sign up using my email and password OR just my mobile number with an OTP verification.

Story 1.3: As a user, I want a simple way to log in and out of my account.

Epic 2: Candidate Experience (Mobile-Centric)

Story 2.1: As Dr. Priya, on my phone, I want to fill out a simple profile with key fields:

Highest Qualification (Dropdown: MBBS, MD, MS, DNB, B.Sc. Nursing, etc.)

Specialty (e.g., General Medicine, Cardiology, Critical Care Nursing)

State Medical Council Registration Number & State

Years of Experience

Story 2.2: As Dr. Priya, I want to easily upload my CV (PDF or Word doc) from my phone's storage.

Story 2.3: As Dr. Priya, I want a simple search interface with three filters: Role/Keyword, City, and Job Type (Permanent, Contract).

Story 2.4: As Dr. Priya, I want to view a clean, mobile-friendly job description page.

Story 2.5: As Dr. Priya, I want to "Apply with my Profile" with one tap.

Story 2.6: As Dr. Priya, I want to receive a WhatsApp message and an email confirming my application was sent.

Epic 3: Employer Experience (Simplified for MVP)

Story 3.1: As Mr. Anand, I want to sign up my hospital with just the hospital name, city, and a contact email address.

Story 3.2: As Mr. Anand, I want a simple form to post a job, with required fields for Job Title, Specialty Required, Experience Range, Location, and a Job Description.

Story 3.3: As Mr. Anand, when a candidate applies, I want to receive an email with the subject "New MedConnect Application: [Job Title]". The body of the email should contain the candidate's key profile data and have their CV attached.
(Note: For MVP, there will be no employer dashboard to view applicants. All interactions are driven via email to maximize simplicity and speed to market.)

6. Design & UX Requirements

MOBILE FIRST. NOT mobile-friendly. The entire experience must be designed for a mobile screen first, and then adapted for desktop.

Lightweight & Fast: Pages must load quickly on variable 3G/4G networks. Use minimal graphics and optimized code.

Clear & Simple Language: The UI will be in English, but use simple, direct language. Avoid complex jargon.

Trust: The platform must look professional and secure. A link to a clear Privacy Policy is essential.
