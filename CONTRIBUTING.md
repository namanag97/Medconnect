# Contributing to MedConnect

We're excited to have you contribute! To keep the process smooth, please adhere to the following guidelines.

## Branching Strategy

All work must be done in a feature branch. The `main` branch is protected and all changes must come through a Pull Request.

Please use the following naming convention for your branches:
- **Features:** `feat/short-description` (e.g., `feat/add-user-profile-page`)
- **Bugfixes:** `fix/short-description` (e.g., `fix/incorrect-password-error`)
- **Documentation:** `docs/short-description` (e.g., `docs/update-hld`)

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes and commit your work using the Conventional Commits format.
3. Ensure your PR is linked to a relevant issue.
4. Provide a clear title and a detailed description in your PR.
5. Request a review from at least one other team member.
6. Once approved, the PR will be squashed and merged by a maintainer.
